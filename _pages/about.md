I am a computational neuroscientist with a background in bioengineering, currently working as a research fellow at Sapienza University of Rome, and finishing my PhD at Politecnico di Milano. My research revolves around one central question: how do brain circuits break — and reorganize — in disease? During my doctoral work, I tackled this problem through multiscale computational models of Parkinson’s disease and motor control, focusing on the interplay between basal ganglia, cerebellum, and whole-brain dynamics.

I work at the intersection of mechanistic modeling and data-driven analysis. On the modeling side, I have developed multiscale frameworks to study how dopamine depletion reshapes neural activity, engaging with large-scale modeling and data integration within the eBRAINS ecosystem. In parallel, over the past two years, I have worked hands-on with experimental EEG data at Sapienza, applying network analysis and hyperscanning approaches in both methodological and applied research settings.

This combination has led me to collaborate on projects spanning neurological and neurodevelopmental conditions, including epilepsy-related studies, autism research within the ACT2 project, and large collaborative initiatives such as Aegeus and CrossBrain. Across these contexts, I have worked with EEG and simulated data, functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI)–based approaches, and cross-subject and cross-brain network analyses.

Technically, I am most at home in Python, working on neural signal acquisition and processing, network and graph-based analysis, image analysis, and machine-learning methods applied to neural time series and imaging-derived data. What motivates me is not just building models or training classifiers, but making sense of them — using computational tools to improve the interpretability of brain dynamics.

Looking ahead, I aim to remain in research-focused roles, open to both academic and applied environments. I am particularly drawn to work with patient data and to research with clear translational relevance, especially in neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders, where computational approaches can genuinely help bridge mechanisms, data, and clinical insight.
