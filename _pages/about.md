I am a computational neuroscientist with a background in bioengineering, currently working as a research fellow at Sapienza University of Rome. I am completing my PhD at Politecnico di Milano, where my research focused on multiscale computational modeling of Parkinson’s disease and motor control, with particular emphasis on interactions between basal ganglia, cerebellum, and whole-brain dynamics.

My research combines mechanistic modeling and data-driven analysis to investigate pathological brain dynamics across different conditions. During my doctoral work, I developed multiscale models to study how dopamine depletion alters neural activity and impacts motor function, also engaging with large-scale modeling and data integration frameworks within the eBRAINS ecosystem. In parallel, over the past two years at Sapienza, I have worked on the analysis of experimental EEG data, applying network analysis and hyperscanning approaches in both methodological and applied research contexts.

Within this framework, I have contributed to projects addressing neurological and neurodevelopmental conditions, including seizure-related studies, autism-focused investigations within the ACT2 project, and large collaborative initiatives such as Aegeus and CrossBrain. These activities involved the analysis of EEG and simulated data, the use of functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI)–based approaches, and cross-subject and cross-brain network analyses.

From a technical perspective, I work primarily in Python and have experience in neural signal acquisition, signal processing, network-based analysis of electrophysiological data, image analysis, and the application of machine learning and AI-based methods to neural time series and imaging-derived data. I am particularly interested in integrating computational models with data-driven approaches to improve the interpretability of brain dynamics in both healthy and pathological conditions.

I aim to continue in research-focused positions, remaining open to both academic and applied environments. My main interest lies in research with translational relevance, especially studies involving patient data and neurological or neurodevelopmental disorders, with the goal of contributing to a deeper mechanistic understanding of disease processes and their potential clinical implications.
