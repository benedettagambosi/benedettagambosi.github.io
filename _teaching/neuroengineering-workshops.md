I supervised project-based workshops within the *Neuroengineering* Master’s course at Politecnico di Milano, focusing on hands-on application of computational and experimental neuroengineering methods.

My responsibilities included designing and supervising team-based projects, guiding students through experimental and computational workflows, and supporting project planning, implementation, and result interpretation. I also delivered dedicated lectures on the NEST simulation environment and assisted students in the development and presentation of final project outcomes.

### Selected student projects
- Automatic quantitative evaluation of joint attention in children with autism spectrum disorder (2021)
- Cerebellum-driven hand-reaching tasks under perturbation using spiking neural network models (2022)
