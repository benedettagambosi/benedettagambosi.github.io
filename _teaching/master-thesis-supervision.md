I co-supervised and tutored Master’s thesis projects at the NEARLab, Politecnico di Milano, mentoring students throughout the full research process, from project definition and methodological design to experimental work and thesis writing.

I supervised five MSc students, fostering a research-oriented and inclusive environment and providing continuous feedback on scientific reasoning, technical implementation, and communication of results.

### Supervised thesis topics
