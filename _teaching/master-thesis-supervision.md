At NEARLab (Politecnico di Milano), I co-supervised Master’s thesis projects and worked closely with students as their ideas slowly turned into actual research. My role spanned everything from shaping early questions and choosing workable methods to navigating experiments, dead ends included, and pulling the final thesis together.

Over time, I supervised five MSc students, aiming to build a research-oriented and inclusive environment. I provided regular, hands-on feedback on how to think scientifically, implement ideas in practice, and communicate results clearly: skills that matter well beyond a single thesis.

### Supervised thesis topics
- A multiarea multiscale neurorobotic controller for Parkinson’s disease study (2022)
- Cell-type–specific connectivity analysis in the mouse somatosensory cortex (2022)
- Diffusive plasticity models in spiking neural networks (2023)
- HiPSC analysis with Multi-Electrode Array technology: setup and methods for a case-control study (2023)
- Signal encoding in a morphologically detailed cerebellar spiking model for simulating an adaptive reaching task (2025)
