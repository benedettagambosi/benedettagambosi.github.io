I have contributed to the *Neuroengineering* Master’s course at Politecnico di Milano as a teaching assistant and project workshop tutor. My role involved supporting course delivery and supervising project-based activities aimed at developing both theoretical understanding and practical skills in neuroengineering.

### Teaching responsibilities
I assisted in lectures and laboratory activities, contributed to the design and supervision of team-based workshops, and supported students in translating theoretical concepts into experimental and computational projects. I delivered dedicated lectures on the NEST simulation environment, moderated paper discussion sessions, and guided students through the design, implementation, and analysis of neuroengineering projects. This role was held continuously from October 2021 to January 2025 and was awarded through competitive teaching calls.

### Project workshops
I supervised and co-supervised student projects focused on applied and translational topics, including:
- Automatic quantitative evaluation of joint attention in children with autism spectrum disorder (2021)
- Cerebellum-driven hand-reaching tasks under perturbation using spiking neural network models (2022)

### Master’s thesis supervision
In parallel, I co-supervised and tutored Master’s thesis projects at the NEARLab (Politecnico di Milano), mentoring students throughout the full research process, from project definition to experimental work and final thesis writing. Supervised topics included:
- Diffusive plasticity models in spiking neural networks (2023)
- hiPSC-based neural activity analysis using MEA technology (2023)
- Signal encoding in morphologically detailed cerebellar spiking neural networks (2025)
- Multiarea neurorobotic controllers for Parkinson’s disease (2022)
- Cell-type–specific connectivity in the mouse somatosensory cortex (2022)

Through these activities, I aimed to foster a research-oriented and inclusive learning environment, encouraging critical thinking, methodological rigor, and independent problem-solving.
