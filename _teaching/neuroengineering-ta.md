I served as a teaching assistant for the *Neuroengineering* Master’s course at Politecnico di Milano, supporting course delivery and student learning activities.

My role included assisting during lectures and laboratory sessions, supporting students in understanding core neuroengineering concepts, and contributing to the development of a research-oriented learning environment. I also moderated paper discussion sessions, encouraging critical reading and discussion of current literature.

This role was held in academic years 2022/23 and 2024/25 and was awarded through competitive teaching calls.
