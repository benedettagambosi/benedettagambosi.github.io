In this talk, as an invited keynote at the NEST Conference 2022, I presented a bio-inspired, multi-area spiking neural network model for motor control, designed to study sensorimotor protocols in neurorobotic simulations. 

Implemented in NEST, the framework couples a spiking neural controller with a simulated arm, explicitly linking neural computation to embodied motor behavior. The controller is composed of interacting functional areas that exchange frequency-coded information, including a detailed cerebellar module implementing spike-timing–dependent plasticity to support motor adaptation.

Neural activity is interfaced with a physical effector through the MUSIC framework and PyBullet, enabling closed-loop control of a single joint. An MPI-based implementation supports distributed simulations and scalability, paving the way for extensions to more complex motor behaviors and higher-dimensional control.
