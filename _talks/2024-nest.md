As an invited speaker at the NEST Conference 2024, I had the chance to present a multiscale, multiarea brain model developed to investigate how dopamine depletion reshapes thalamocortical beta oscillations in parkinsonism. 

The model integrates spiking neural network representations of the basal ganglia and cerebellum with a neural mass model of cortical and thalamic loops, allowing pathological and physiological dynamics to be studied within a unified framework.

Simulations show that reproducing key experimental signatures of Parkinson’s disease, in particular enhanced beta-band activity, requires accounting for dopamine-dependent alterations in both the basal ganglia and the cerebellum, rather than in the basal ganglia alone. By extending the model to a cerebellum-dependent learning task, we further show that adaptive mechanisms are preserved but degraded under pathological conditions, highlighting the cerebellum’s active role in parkinsonian dynamics.
