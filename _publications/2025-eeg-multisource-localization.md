Accurate localization of neural sources from electroencephalography (EEG) signals remains a challenging inverse problem, particularly in the presence of multiple simultaneously active sources. In this work, we propose a deep learning–based framework designed to address multi-source EEG localization by learning complex, non-linear mappings between scalp-recorded signals and underlying source configurations. 

The proposed approach is evaluated on simulated EEG data under different source configurations and noise conditions, showing improved localization performance compared to traditional methods. These results suggest that deep learning techniques can provide a flexible and scalable tool for addressing multi-source EEG localization in realistic settings, with potential applications in both clinical and research contexts.
