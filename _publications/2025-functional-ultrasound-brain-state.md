Functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI) has emerged as a promising non-invasive neuroimaging modality that leverages neurovascular coupling to capture hemodynamic changes associated with neuronal activity. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of fUSI for classifying brain states in both healthy and pathological scenarios using computational simulations based on neural mass models. By converting simulated electrophysiological signals into fUSI-like traces and training a convolutional neural network to distinguish between control and pathological conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and epilepsy, we explore the strengths and limitations of fUSI signals for reliable state classification. Results show that while electrophysiological data often yield higher accuracy due to finer temporal resolution, fUSI retains sufficient discriminative information for meaningful classification tasks, supporting its potential as a cost-effective alternative for brain state analysis in both research and clinical contexts.
