This study investigates the effects of a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) intervention during pregnancy on maternal brain structure and function. Using neuroimaging and longitudinal analysis, the work examines how stress-reduction interventions may be associated with measurable changes in the maternal brain, contributing to the understanding of neuroplasticity during pregnancy and the potential impact of behavioral interventions on maternal mental health.
