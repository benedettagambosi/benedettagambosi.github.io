This article explores how spiking neural network models of cerebellar circuits can bridge cellular dynamics and global brain function. By simulating detailed microcircuit structure and synaptic interactions, we show how microscopic phenomena influence emergent behavior in larger networks, offering a computational pathway to understand cerebellar contributions to motor control and learning.
