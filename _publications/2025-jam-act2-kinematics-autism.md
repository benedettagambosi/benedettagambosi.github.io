Movement kinematics provide crucial information about action goals and intentions and play a fundamental role in dyadic interactions, supporting coordination between interacting agents. In autism spectrum conditions, differences in motor execution and action decoding have been reported, potentially impacting social motor interactions.

This ongoing study investigates how motor similarities and dissimilarities influence dyadic coordination. A screening task is used to quantify motor distance by recording kinematic features during a time-constrained pointing task in individuals with autism and typically developing participants. Motor distance between participants is computed using kinematic feature comparison and Procrustes transformation, enabling systematic pairing based on movement similarity. This approach aims to support controlled investigation of how motor distance affects coordination performance in joint action tasks.
