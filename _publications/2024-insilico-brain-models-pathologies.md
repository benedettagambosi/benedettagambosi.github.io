This book chapter reviews the use of in silico brain models to investigate neurological pathologies, with a focus on how computational approaches can bridge multiple spatial and temporal scales. The chapter discusses the role of mechanistic modeling in interpreting experimental data, exploring disease mechanisms, and supporting the development of neurotechnological tools for diagnosis and rehabilitation.
